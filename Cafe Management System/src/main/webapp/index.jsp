			<h2 class="text-center">Chole Bhature</h2>
			<p class="p-3">Chole Bhature also known as Chana Bhatura is one
				of the most popular Punjabi dish liked almost all over India. Chana
				Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish
				at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba
				(eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the
				chickpea curry. In some places the curry is very spicy, at other
				places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also
				varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry. Our product does not
				taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.</p>

			<h2 class="text-center">Pizza</h2>
			<p class="p-3">
				Be it any occasion, we all love to eat pizza at home. Pizza is one
				of the most sought-after dishes of Italian cuisine. Whether it’s the
				Super Bowl or the NBA Finals, the meal of choice for many game
				lovers will most likely be pizza. <i><b>The Friendly Bean
						Cafe </b></i> often records selling over 2000 pizzas during the Super Bowl
				every year. It’s not only delicious but also easy to share with
				friends and family as you enjoy the game together. You can easily
				grab a slice and wash it down with a cold beer or other drink of
				your choice. Life could not get any better.
